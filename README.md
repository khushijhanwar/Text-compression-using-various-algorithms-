# Text-compression-using-various-algorithms-
Text compression algorithms aim at statistical reductions in the volume of data. It involves changing the representation of a file so that the (binary) compressed output takes less space to store, or less time to transmit. Still the original file can be reconstructed exactly from its compressed representation.
